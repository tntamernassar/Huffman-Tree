# Huffman-Tree

With this Huffman tree implementation you can : 
 - Create a huffman tree from text
 - Create a huffman tree from given chars with them frequancies
 - encode text using the huffman tree created
 - Bit-encode text using the Huffman Tree
 - Decode using the Huffman Tree
 - Serialize the Huffman Tree
with freeing memory
